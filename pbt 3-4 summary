Killing Unit tests
----------------
There is no doubt that Unit tests are an essential part of the development process today.
However, writing unit tests is a tedious and repetitive job that is often unrewarding since bugs slip away.
Property-based testing addresses these issues by providing a way to define laws and properties on your data types and generate tests to verify them.

In this talk I'll explain what Property based testing and Law testing are, and share some concrete examples from the work we do in bigPanda.

Note: this session will be given in English.

See you there!
